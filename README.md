ACTIVITY 1 (ELEC 3)

 I created a responsive navigation bar that works well on both large and small screens.
 On bigger screens, the dropdown menu shows up when you hover over it. 
 For smaller screens, the menu changes into a mobile-friendly version with a 
 side menu that you can toggle on and off.
 
  The HTML sets up the structure of the navigation bar, making it clear and easy to use.
  The CSS handles the styling, ensuring everything looks good on any device. 
  Media queries help adjust the layout for different screen sizes, keeping it responsive. 
  JavaScript adds interactivity, making it easy to open and close the mobile menu and control the dropdowns, 
  making the navigation user-friendly on mobile devices.
